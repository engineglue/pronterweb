Welcome to the WebFace open source web based printer interface project.

Our intent is to create and distribute a web interface which has similar 
functionality to Pronter Face for use with open source 3d printers.

This will entail a light Python web server which can send posted 
commands and posted gcode files to a serial port connected 3d printer. 
It will also include a client side web site which utilizes HTML, 
Javascript, CSS and jQuery.

At this point we'd like to utilize the printcore.py source file from
the Pronter Face project in order to handle the communication to/from
the printer.

If you have questions or if you are interested in contributing to the
project, please contact engineglue at #reprap or engineglue@gmail.com
