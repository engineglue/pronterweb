Welcome to the WebFace open source web based printer interface project.

Our intent is to create and distribute a web interface which has similar 
functionality to Pronterface by Kliment for use with open source 3d printers.

This will entail a light Python web server which can send posted 
commands and posted gcode files to a serial port connected 3d printer. 
It will also include a client side web site which utilizes HTML, 
Javascript, CSS and jQuery.

You can access all of the project files from webface 0.0.1

If you have questions or if you are interested in contributing to the
project, please contact engineglue at #reprap or engineglue@gmail.com
