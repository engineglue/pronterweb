Welcome to the WebFace open source web based printer interface project.

Our intent is to create and distribute a web interface which has similar 
functionality to Pronter Face for use with open source 3d printers.

This will entail a light Python web server which can send posted 
commands and posted gcode files to a serial port connected 3d printer. 
It will also include a client side web site which utilizes HTML, 
Javascript, CSS and jQuery.

If you have questions or if you are interested in contributing to the
project, please contact engineglue at #reprap or engineglue@gmail.com
